BIDS NORDIC wrapper

purpose: take an input BIDS func directory, apply NORDIC denoising and trim noise volumes 

usage:
1) Convert source data to BIDS with Dcm2bids. BIDS task names for the converted files are expected to be as follows:

"task-restSE" and "task-restSEph", respectively for single-echo magnitude and phase BOLD timeseries
"task-restME" and "task-restMEph" for multi-echo

(An example dcm2bids config file which outputs the expected task names is in "dcm2bids_conf_examples")

2) Run bids_nordic_wrapper.sh (arg1= path to func dir, arg2= number of noise volumes at end of each run)

3) [Optional] Run nordic_cleanup.sh to remove logs and other files not used in further processing
